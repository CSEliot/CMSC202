This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents.  The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.  No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.   </FONT></UL>


<UL><FONT SIZE="2"></FONT></UL>


<UL><FONT SIZE="2">c)	Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise.  As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.  For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.</FONT></UL>

<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B></B>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:</FONT>

<UL><FONT SIZE="2">a)	it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and</FONT></UL>

<P><FONT SIZE="2" COLOR="#0000FF"><STRIKE></STRIKE></FONT><FONT SIZE="2">Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.  </FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"></FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE="2">Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.  </FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"></FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"><B>4.  COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</B></FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE="2">Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like.  While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.   Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.  The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.  In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.  The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE="2"></FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE="2">For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X.  That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.  If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone.  Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.</FONT>
